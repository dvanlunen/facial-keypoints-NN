    "# Facial Keypoint Detection Project\n",
    "The objective of this project was to predict keypoints' positions on images of faces using kaggle facial keypoints detection competions dataset. We explored various nerual network structures for our predictions and ultimately trained two models for project submission. Our final solution's predictions submitted to kaggle produced a RMSE error of 1.71947 on the unseen test data labels. This placed us 4th on the public Kaggle leaderboard. \n",

    "### Notes about the directory structure\n",
    "The zip file submitted contains 3 folders.\n",
    "1. data: This folder contains the competition data. *Idlookuptable*, *test*, *training*, and *samplesubmission* files in this folder are needed for this notebook to run. Training data should be unzipped before running the notebook.\n",
    "2. notebook: This folder contains this main subission notebook. It also contains a subfolder with a screenshot (img) of Kaggle score, and another subfolder (augmentdata) that defines a custom image generating class.\n",
    "3. saved-models: This folder contains the saved models weights of final models in .h5 files. It also has a subfolder that contains the training history in pickle files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remarks\n",
    "- The images clearly came from two different marking schemes so training separate models for the images that came with different numbers of keypoints reduced our training/validation loss.\n",
    "- Augmentation in image data was a nice way to artifically increase the variance in our training dataset and improved the model.\n",
    "- Convolutions significantly improved the results.\n",
    "- Different optimizers worked differently under different circumstances - https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-optimization-algorithms-used-in-neural-networks-and-ways-to-optimize-gradient-95ae5d39529f. Nadam converged faster and seemed to approach the same minimum as Adam. However, Adam did achieve a better minimum loss for the simple models without convolutions.\n",
    "- Normalization was helpful (both of the features and the output) and helped prevent divergence.\n",
    "- Batch normalization worked well after the activation. https://github.com/ducha-aiki/caffenet-benchmark/blob/master/batchnorm.md\n",
    "- Dropout and batch normalization together seemed to cause weird differences between training and validation error due to \"variance shift\". One fix was to only apply dropout after all the batch normalization layers had been applied. http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05134v1\n",
    "- After bringing validation loss more in line with training loss through normalization and dropout, adding further complexity through more layers seemed to further reduce the validation loss.\n",
    "- Though ReLu is the most popular activation function, Exponential Linear Units (ELU) in some cases give better results because their mean value is closer to zero and thus they allow less bias to propagate through the network. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07289.pdf\n",
    "- Though training pre-tuned models (\"from the zoo\") is likely a good choice in real world applications, our results training InceptionNetV3 and VGG did not show loss lower than our simpler architectures. This likely could be due to the small size of our training dataset.\n",
    "- Large strides and convolution window sizes generally worked worse than smaller convolutions with a stride of 1. Smaller windows were in line with the ideas presented in the InceptionV3 model paper of replacing larger windows with multiple small windows. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567.pdf\n",
    "- Depth and additional data significantly increased training time.\n",
    "- GPUs gave a ~30x speedup over CPU training. They were definitely necessary to quickly train, test and evaluate various models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further exploration\n",
    "Given more time, there are a number of other things we would have evaluated:\n",
    "- Use cross validation to see if our best architectures hold up when the seed value is not 42.\n",
    "- Testing more advanced, inception based architectures.\n",
    "- Utilizing the images with missing keypoints (total keypoints != 30 or 8). Our solution used only images with 30 or 8 keypoints train models.\n",
    "- Training a separate model for the eye keypoints that uses the data in both groups of images, since it appears the two labelling schemes were the same for the center of the eye keypoints.\n",
    "- Tuning the amounts of data augmentation used.\n",
    "- Importing layers and hyperparameter settings from the other group's model, to see if those settings offer improvement over the current group's model.\n",
    "- Use Ensemble architecture to split dataset based on number of available keypoints, train on separate models and combine results.\n",
